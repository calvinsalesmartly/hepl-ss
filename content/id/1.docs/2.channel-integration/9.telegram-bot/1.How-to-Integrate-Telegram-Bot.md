## Frequently asked questions

### **1. Can Telegram Bot be bound to multiple projects? If so, will the messages still be synchronized?**

1.1 Can only be bound to one project. Telegram Bot’s webhook will only take effect on one project. This is the official rule of Telegram. After binding a new project, the webhook of the old project will become invalid. Therefore, the messages of Telegram Bot bound to multiple projects will not be synchronized.

1.2. If you are not binding multiple projects, re-authorize Telegram_Bot to see if you can receive messages.

### **2. Can the messages from Telegram Bot be received on Telegram App?**

Telegram App is a private account and cannot receive messages from Telegram Bot. It can only be received in the background of our system.
