### 2.5. Synchronize contacts & create conversations

> You can also sync your Instagram contacts to SaleSmartly, making it easier for you to reply to chats, send group messages, and more .

Click **to synchronize contacts**. This function **only supports synchronization of contacts with whom you have chatted. Contacts that have been inactive for more than 30 days or whose accounts are blocked cannot be synchronized. After the first integration, the system will automatically synchronize the latest 20 chat records of the most recent 20 contacts, which can be viewed in the [[Customer List](https://help-en.salesmartly.com/docs/customer-list/)].**

If the synchronization time is too long, you can click Cancel Sync to cancel the contact synchronization process.

After synchronizing contacts, you can also confirm the progress by viewing the synchronization records. The synchronized contacts can **be viewed in the [Customer - Customer List].**

You can **only** **generate a conversation** after synchronizing your contacts. SaleSmartly will read your historical conversations and generate them in **the online chat**.

> Please note: Synchronizing contacts will not synchronize chat records of contacts that already exist in the SaleSmartly customer list. If the contact does not exist in the customer list, only the most recent 20 message records of this contact will be synchronized.
