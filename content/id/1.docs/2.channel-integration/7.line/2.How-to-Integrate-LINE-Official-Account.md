## 1. Introduction

Integrating your LINE Official Account with SaleSmartly enables real-time synchronization of chat messages, helping businesses respond instantly to user inquiries through a unified dashboard. This allows seamless multi-channel customer service while leveraging LINE’s real-time messaging capabilities.

Unlike personal LINE accounts, official accounts offer higher messaging efficiency, audience targeting, and professional use, which is ideal for separating work from personal life. They also support multi-user access across platforms. Integration via the LINE Messaging API enhances your customer service strategy with automation and scalability.
