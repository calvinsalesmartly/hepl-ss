### The number of devices is 0/1. When you click Add Device, it prompts that the number has reached the upper limit?

You can check the number status. The current logic is: valid/invalid/unconnected/configured numbers will occupy the number of device numbers. You can check and delete invalid numbers, and then try to add devices.

### What messages does the TikTok app support?

Currently, the TikTok App supports private messages and comments within the App. Sending messages through the TikTok App only supports text content.
