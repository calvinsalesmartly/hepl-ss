## 1. Introduction

Integrate Telegram personal accounts with SaleSmartly to manage real-time chats and unify customer interactions across channels. Unlike Telegram Bot API, which automates workflows via bot accounts, this method connects actual user profiles, letting teams handle conversations directly. Choose between bot or personal account integration based on your workflow needs, with flexibility for every scenario.

## 2. Step-by-Step Guide

> First, ensure your account has available Telegram Cloud Device Quota (The free version currently provides only 1 quota). If additional devices are needed for Telegram App operations, you can go to the [Cost Center] to upgrade your plan or purchase extra quotas.

### 2.1. Add a device

Click **[Integrate]** - **[Telegram App]**, then click **[Add Device]**, **[Select IP Region],** and then click **[OK]. If you need IP in other regions, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us.**

> Please note: Select the region where you frequently log in to Telegram App or a nearby region. If you have your own proxy IP, you can click ⑥[Set Proxy] IP in the picture on the right

### 2.2. Enter App api_id, App api_hash and mobile phone number

Return to the SaleSmartly integration interface, **enter the App api_id and App api_hash you obtained and your area code + mobile phone number** > click **Save** to enter the account verification interface. Please be sure to enter your mobile phone number in the correct format.

> Note: You do not need to enter “+” in front of the mobile phone number, but you need to add the area code.
