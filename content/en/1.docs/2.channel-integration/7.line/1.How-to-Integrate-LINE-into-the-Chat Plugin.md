## 1. Introduction

Below, you will learn how to integrate LINE in the chat plugin.

This article mainly discusses:

- **How to create an official LINE account?**
- **How to create a Messaging API channel?**
- **How to create a Login channel?**
- **How to integrate into the LINE plugin portal?**

(Please create LINE’s Login channel and Messaging API channel under the same Providers. Create a LINE official account means creating a new account, which is similar to a WeChat official account.)

> Note: Only LINE official accounts can be integrated into the plugin portal.
